All the things for our 21M.385 final project.

TODO: 

-mark as wrong/make nodes disappear after one measure passes since last click
-try Kivy 3-D
-put shapes in the center
-doing animations for pushing (getting rid of timers)
-pulsing background
-add play screen
-add end screen of song


How to play:
Spellbinder can be played with either the keyboard or a PlayStation move controller.

Keyboard:
Click to draw runes on the screen. These will form your shapes. Press 'm' to complete the spell.

PSMove:
Step two arm lengths away from the camera. Press the trigger to draw runes. These will form your shapes. Press the main move button to complete the spell.

General Gameplay:
In SpellBinder, you play as Echo, silent defender of Silence. Wielding your core belief that Silence is golden, you wage battle against the forces of Sound and Music.

Your spells come in 5 varieties: halos(circles), slashes(x), triangles(triangles), mirrors(squares), and gems(diamonds). Each spell has its unique sequence of motions, all ending in a push (the move button or 'm' on the keyboard).

The beats coming from Sound are displayed at the top of the screen. Downbeats are labeled white, and pushing on downbeats deals extra damage.

Good luck!

Sincerely,
